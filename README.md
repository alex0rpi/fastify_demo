# Fastify demo with swagger

This is a mix of tutorials I followed that I joined together into a single project. Basically I joined together the key concepts learned from codelive and traversy media tutorials.
https://www.youtube.com/live/r7cjW_IlHHk?si=-VDo6pg7lmcxW0tj
uses SalesForce API for API management: https://developer.salesforce.com/

codelive: updated info about swagger integration
traversy: good begginer friendly tutorial on how to setup routes and controllers with schema validations.

Key concepts to understand:

- Learn the basic commands, of fastify-cli, it really helps to get things correctly setup from the beggining.
- Fastify register middlewares and routes
- Fastify schema validation in opts objects
- Integration with swagger
- Import OPENAPI setup in Postman

I believe this framework, Fastify, has potential for me to replace express in many projects to come.

## Next steps:

- learn how to integrate with databases such as MONGODB and PostgreSQ with tools like Prisma, Sequelize or Mongoose.
